# JD Weather Library

### About

1. Provides the ability for developers to integrate with a choice of many weather services to fetch weather data, including conditions, alerts, forecasts, and maps.
2. Standardizes weather data into a single common structure regardless of which service it came from.
3. Support functions to describe which features are available and which are not in a given service.
4. Lookup weather data by any given number of location information.
5. Each weather service encapsulated in a DLL (Source Included).
6. Add support for new services by writing a new DLL.

### IMPORTANT NOTE

This library is currently in active development, and is not currently functional. It is actually the third complete iteration of this project. 

### Disclaimer

The code and resources in this repository are in no way guaranteed. The author(s) of the library are not responsible for any incorrect, corrupt, damaging, or otherwise undesired results. You take full responsibility to ensure this library suits your requirements. You also take full responsibility to abide by the chosen service(s) guidelines in their corresponding documentation. This includes limited number of requests, limited availability of information, presentation of weather data, and presentation of trademark information and logos. Be sure to thoroughly read the documentation for the chosen service(s) to gain knowledge of these requirements.

### Supported Weather Services

1. [Weather Underground](Readme/WUnderground.md)
2. [AccuWeather](Readme/AccuWeather.md)
3. [OpenWeatherMap](Readme/OpenWeatherMap.md)
4. [Foreca](Readme/Foreca.md)
5. [Weather Source OnPOINTÂ®](Readme/OnPOINT.md)

### How to Create Instance

1. Create implementation objects for all interfaces found in `JD.Weather.Intf.pas`.
  1. This unit is shared across boundaries, and contains all common types, classes, interfaces, and functions required.
  2. You can use the objects as already found in the same unit, as well as what's found in each DLL.
2. Load the library `JDWeather.dll` and get the proc address for `CreateJDWeather`.
  1. There is a procedure type already defined in the interface unit, called `TCreateJDWeather`.
3. Call the function `CreateJDWeather` to obtain a new instance of a `IJDWeather` interface.

**NOTE:** In the future, this will not be necessary, as another component will be written to accommodate for this task.

```delphi
  FLib:= LoadLibrary('JDWeather.dll');
  if FLib <> 0 then begin
    FCreateLib:= GetProcAddress(FLib, 'CreateJDWeather');
    if Assigned(FCreateLib) then begin
      try
        FWeather:= FCreateLib(ExtractFilePath(ParamStr(0)));
        LoadServices;
      except
        on E: Exception do begin
          raise Exception.Create('Failed to create new instance of "IJDWeather": '+E.Message);
        end;
      end;
    end else begin
      raise Exception.Create('Function "CreateJDWeather" not found!');
    end;
  end else begin
    E:= GetLastError;
    raise Exception.Create('Failed to load library "JDWeather.dll" with error code '+IntToStr(E));
  end;
```

### How to Use

1. Choose a service from `IJDWeather.Services`
  1. `Count` returns the number of services
  2. `Items[]` returns a given service by its index
2. Create an account with chosen service and obtain API key
3. Use the `Support` property of a service to see what pieces of information are supported.
4. Wait until I get more stuff implemented and working here...
